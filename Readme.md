## Advent of Code

My solutions for [Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/)

Code is in typscript, and the main focus is on speed, correctness and performance. It is definitely not be the best looking production code out there

 I'm running this using bun, but node with a typescript compiler should work as well:

```sh
bun run 2024/day1/solve.ts
```

Note: the input files are not committed, [as requested by AoC itself](https://adventofcode.com/about#faq_copying). You can add your own as `input.txt` in each day directory.
